Nu i Trädgården
===============

This is a small project to make some track of plats in the garden.

It should be possible to add plants.

For plats it should be (optionally) traced:

* Where and when purcased
* When planted
* Location

The user should get:

* Tips on what to do this week
* Tips on matching plats and flowers

Tips should be possible to tick as done.
Tips should be possible to repeat, daily, weekly, every x days.
Tips should be limited to the time of year where they are usefull, e.g. when the snow is thick dont remind to mow the lawn.

Additional things:

* Log of what work been done.
* Log of insects, vermins etc.
